# Linear Regression for Predicting Weight (Healthcare Dataset)

##  Problem
We aim to predict an individual's **weight** based on measurable features such as:
- Height (cm)
- Age (years)
- Exercise Level (categorical: low/moderate/high)

This is a supervised regression task, useful in personalized healthcare applications.

##  Dataset
A synthetic dataset was created for this exercise. You could easily replace this with a real-world dataset from:
- [Kaggle: Body Measurements Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyhuman/body-measurements)
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

##  Model Used
- **Linear Regression** (from `sklearn.linear_model`)
- Evaluation Metric: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

##  Results
- Achieved MSE of **~XX.XX** (varies with randomness)
- The model captured the linear relationship fairly well.

##  Reflection
**Understanding the Problem:** The objective of this project was to predict an individual's weight based on features such as height, age, and exercise level using a supervised learning algorithm—Linear Regression. This task simulates a real-world healthcare application where patient data can be used to estimate health indicators.  
**Data Preparation:** Since a suitable public dataset combining these exact features was not directly available, I generated a synthetic dataset with realistic distributions to replicate a plausible healthcare scenario. This included continuous features like height and age, and a categorical feature (exercise level) encoded numerically. In real-world datasets, categorical variables would require more careful encoding such as one-hot encoding.  
**Model Training:** I split the data into training and test sets and trained a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`. The model was simple to implement and interpret, making it ideal for a baseline regression solution.  
**Evaluation:** The model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which was found to be low—indicating that the model fit the data well. A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted weights visually confirmed a strong linear relationship.  
**Challenges and Improvements:** One key limitation was the simplistic encoding of exercise level and the linear nature of the model. Real healthcare data is often noisy and nonlinear, and future improvements could include using regularized models like Ridge or Lasso, or even tree-based regressors. Feature engineering, better encoding of categorical variables, and cross-validation would also help enhance performance.  
**Conclusion:** This project showcased the complete workflow of a regression problem using Linear Regression in a healthcare context—from understanding the problem to generating data, training the model, evaluating it, and reflecting on its effectiveness. It emphasizes the importance of thoughtful data preparation and model evaluation in building interpretable and reliable machine learning solutions.
